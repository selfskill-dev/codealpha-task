# codealpha-task
"Welcome to my project demo. This system detects emotions from voice recordings. After uploading a file like audio1.wav, it extracts features using MFCCs and predicts whether the speaker sounds happy, sad, or angry using a trained machine learning model. Built with Python and TensorFlow, and google collab."

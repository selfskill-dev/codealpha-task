"Welcome to my project demo. This system detects emotions from voice recordings. After uploading a file like audio1.wav, it extracts features using MFCCs and predicts whether the speaker sounds happy, sad, or angry using a trained machine learning model. Built with Python and TensorFlow, and google collab."
 Project Summary: Emotion Detection from Voice Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting emotions from human speech using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to analyze a personâ€™s voice and predict whether the emotion being expressed is happy, sad, or angry. The system allows a user to upload a voice recording file (in .wav format), which is then processed by the model to determine the emotional tone of the speaker.

The process begins by uploading an audio file. Once the file is uploaded, the system extracts important features from the audio using MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), which are commonly used in audio signal processing. These features capture the essence of how humans hear and interpret sounds, making them ideal for emotion classification.

After feature extraction, the data is passed to a pre-trained machine learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras. This model has been trained on a labeled dataset containing voice samples with known emotional categories. The model uses this learned knowledge to analyze the uploaded audio and make a prediction.

Once the analysis is complete, the system outputs one of the three emotions: Happy, Sad, or Angry, depending on the voice tone. The user can then choose to upload another file to test a different emotion. The platform is designed to be simple and interactive, allowing multiple audio inputs and instant predictions.

The entire system is implemented in Google Colab, utilizing Python libraries such as Librosa for audio processing, NumPy for numerical computation, and TensorFlow/Keras for model loading and prediction. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and audio signal processing can be combined to understand human emotions from voice.

This application has real-world use cases in areas such as mental health monitoring, customer support systems, voice assistants, and human-computer interaction. In the future, the system can be enhanced to detect more emotions like fear or surprise, support live microphone input, and be deployed as a web or mobile application.
